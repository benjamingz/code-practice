      &emsp;A common struggle among gym-goers is a looming uncertainty on what you should be doing there. Some may perform bicep curls, or a squat variation, but not really <em>know</em> what it is that they're doing, let alone what they want overall when going to the gym. They shouldn't be ashamed for this because this can be very complex.

  <p class="mainbody">
    &emsp; There are many factors that can affect your goal, but some are crucial to consider before deciding which path to follow in the gym world. Something to understand before ever beginning is that to create your ideal goal, there is no one solution, and there is no solution with one factor. For example, to lose weight, solely working out without considering diet, hydration, or sleep will no effectively decrease your weight. The things that will affect your goal are:
    <ol class="mainbody">
      <li class="">Diet</li>
      <li>Physical Activity</li>
      <li>Sleep</li>
      <li>Hydration</li>
